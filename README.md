This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML related to the use of `innerHTML` to remove elements from the DOM. The `bug.html` file shows the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.html` demonstrates a corrected approach. The issue arises from the fact that setting `innerHTML` to an empty string only clears the content of an element, it does not remove the element itself from the DOM. This can lead to unexpected behavior in subsequent scripts or styling.
